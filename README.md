# ices2-scripts
A collection of custom bash scripts for running an online radio 

# Where/Why would I need this?
Truth of the matter is, you really probably don't. 

These scripts are heavily customized to my specific use-case.  I plan on creating a neat little package that one can install that comes with a web interface and all that jazz but I'll try to straighten out all the bugs first. :)

If anyone is interested on seeing the .json API in action, this is a little custom site running on Ices2, Icecast2 and Apache (and the magic that is Apache CGI)

I hold absolutely no rights to the music that is played on there and considering that this is all just duct-taped together bash scripts anyways, it probably won't be online that reliably anyways.  Enjoy.
