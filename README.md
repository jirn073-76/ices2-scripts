# ices2-scripts
A collection of custom bash scripts for running an online radio 

# Where/Why would I need this?
Truth of the matter is, you really probably don't. The problem it solves probably doesn't exist anymore.  

If anyone is interested in seeing the .json API in action, this is a little custom site running on Ices2, Icecast2 and Apache / Apache CGI.

I hold absolutely no rights to the music that is played on there and considering that this is all just duct-taped together bash scripts anyways, it probably won't be online that reliably anyways.  Enjoy.
